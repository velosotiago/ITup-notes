# 1.1. Basics
## Base Syntax
SELECT *
FROM Product
WHERE Origin LIKE 'Spain';

## Operators
`=` : Equals
`<>` : Different
`<, >` : Greater Than, Less Than
`BETWEEN x AND y` : Number between x and y (inclusive)
`LIKE ...` : Used to compare strings
`x IS NULL, x IS NOT NULL` : Select x if value is(n't) NULL
`x IN y` : Select x if value is in y, where y is a list of values
`EXISTS x` : Select x if it has a value (NULL is a value)

## Text Patterns (for use with LIKE)
`%` : Any text
`_` : Any Char

E.g.:
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM Customers AS C
WHERE C.CompanyName LIKE '%House_'
/* Returns all Customers with House
suffixed by any character in CompanyName */
```

## Logical Operators

`AND`
`OR`
AND takes priority over OR; if the opposite behaviour is desirable, wrap conditions in parenthesis.

E.g.:
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM Customers AS C
WHERE (C.LastName = 'Orwell' OR C.LastName = 'Marx')
AND C.FirstName = 'George';
```
